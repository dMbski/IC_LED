WS2812 LED Controller with IR support

So Xmas is coming up in a couple of days...

And I want to make something more interesting for Christmas tree decoration...

...Yes, it is yet another LED-with-IC strip controller written for Arduino.

But main thing is LED light string. To make one you can engage Wife and Children.

For them it is more interresting then a paper chain ;-)
